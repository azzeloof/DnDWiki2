Tam is Grey Hawk's blacksmith and a former adventurer.  He rarely talks about his adventuring days, but earned some renown as a Forge Cleric in a party about three decades ago.  He cashed in his spoils to set up [[Places/Tam's Forge and Blacksmith Shop\|Tam's Forge and Blacksmith Shop]] in [[Places/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]] and settled down to live a quieter life.  He recently took Wrenn under his wing as an apprentice, seeing their innate talent for the forge and insatiable curiosity as a blessing that could be the start of something great.  As a former cleric he is often found praying in [[Places/Geshtai's Chapel\|Geshtai's Chapel]] or helping to heal the injured when not at the forge.
