Dug is a half-dwarf who loves digging but is very claustrophobic, so naturally he took the job of town undertaker in [[Places/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]].  He is mostly solitary, living in his hut overlooking the town graveyard and tending to his garden.  He has never married and has no strong feelings on the matter.
