Bailey would lose his head if it wasn't attached, he is constantly looking for something he misplaced, a running joke among the other townsfolk. Naturally Bailey is one of the clerks who oversees day-to-day accounting for the [[Places/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]]'s limited government and acts as a personal assistant to [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reeve Fona Goldcrest\|Reeve Fona Goldcrest]], who is constantly exasperated with his foolishness.
