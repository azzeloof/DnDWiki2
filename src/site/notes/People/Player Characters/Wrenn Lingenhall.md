Wrenn is apprentice blacksmith to [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Tam Thunderhand\|Tam Thunderhand]], and has lived in [[Places/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]] for about a year. They left their clan from deep in [[Places/The High Forest\|The High Forest]] because they were curious to see the world, the things people make, and to learn to make those things themself. Greyhawk is the "biggest city" they've ever been to. They're excited to be here.
