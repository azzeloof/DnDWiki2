[[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Nora Gremble\|Nora Gremble]]'s beloved horse, [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Clarence\|Clarence]] recently returned from a midnight trot covered in blood and clear marks of a beast attack.  He usually doesn't venture too far from town so that could be a problem if the next victim isn't so lucky.  Also he seemed to magically heal overnight which is strange.
