## Session Notes
[[Quests/Quest List\|Quest List]]
### Session 4
*Greenwake 42*
- Party discussed moral implications of destroying Grung spawning pool
- While about 2 miles north of town a small figure appeared and stole Wrenn's 100gp pearl
- The party chased but it escaped all grapples with slippery oil on its skin and using small dimensional rifts to flee.  Party opted not to chase into [[Places/The High Forest\|The High Forest]]
- Saw [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Clarence\|Clarence]] walking around in the forest, Nira called him over and fed him some hay then they all went back to town
- Back in town they saw the villagers queueing up to go into a small booth set up with a magical aura around it
- Feannag snuck up to it and overheard [[People/Other Adventurers/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]] interviewing villagers one-by-one for info on the shapeshifter.  He was using Zone of Truth to get secrets out of people, and guards were marking off names from the book when they had been vetted by Alduin
- Aired went in for an interrogation, passed easily, Cock went in and was detained for not being able to answer truthfully due to his failed memory
- Nira was able to vouch for him to get him free of the guard's quarters
- Feannag and Wrenn had no interest in being interrogated, wanted to sneak away and avoid Alduin
- Feannag stealthily tracked [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bailey Fanteaser\|Bailey Fanteaser]] back to his house with the book of names, then stole the book, crossed his own name off, and left the book on Bailey's porch
- Went to see [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/'Greasy' Greg Gremble\|'Greasy' Greg Gremble]] who was able to identify the slippery and sticky goo they collected from the goblinoid thief as coming from a Boggle, a bogeyman chaotic evil fey who use trickery and thievery to cause mischief and steal shiny trinkets
- Sold Orange Grung poison to Greg, who examined it and said it had nothing to do with the poisoning of the water supply, suggested the cursed fluid could be from some sort of evil fey in the area
- Party set about gathering shiny trinkets to try to catch the Boggle in a trap behind [[Places/The Bursting Barrel\|The Bursting Barrel]], Feannag bought stuff from the market and Wrenn polished up steel armor scraps from [[Places/Tam's Forge and Blacksmith Shop\|Tam's Forge and Blacksmith Shop]]
- Managed to catch the Boggle, who answered questions in exchange for shiny "treasures"
- It's name is [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Goop\|Goop]], and it lives under Bailey's house and fucks with him constantly.  Traded trinkets for Wrenn's pearl and a small magic item.  Goop also mentioned that the vile liquid smelled like "her," some mysterious mistress who hurt it before.  
- Rip cast Alarm on [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Simon Sais\|Simon Sais]]'s door to try to catch the culprit of the banging
### Session 3
*Greenwake 41-42*
- Short rest at [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/'Greasy' Greg Gremble\|'Greasy' Greg Gremble]]'s house while he used his alchemy equipment to analyze the well water, was able to distill a black curse fluid out of the water, which Aired took.  He also mentioned it could be from something evil or poisonous living in the water and contaminating it.  
- Greg also mentioned that he was working on Lightning Resistance Potions with the Shambling Mound fluid and that they should bring interesting fluids to him for trade in the future
- Went to [[Places/The Bursting Barrel\|The Bursting Barrel]] and spoke with [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Nora Gremble\|Nora Gremble]], [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Gerthwin Bartelby\|Gerthwin Bartelby]], and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Dutch 'The Boozer King' Ottenbrau\|Dutch 'The Boozer King' Ottenbrau]], while Nora was feeding [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Clarence\|Clarence]], who seemed to have miraculously healed from his injuries the night before
- Went to the docks of the fishing village, met [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Yarr Xibloes\|Yarr Xibloes]] who offered to take them out to look for the mermaid in the morning
- Went back to The Bursting Barrel where Tony's Pajamas were found, [[People/Other Adventurers/Void\|Void]] was already there, they described the danger of the shapeshifter and how they'd been tracking it for over a year since it's kind wiped out their village somewhere among the stars
- Long Rest
- Woke up early and went out with Yarr to find the mermaid by the waterfall
- [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Saoirse\|Saoirse]] introduced herself, said she'd been living in the lake for years but the poison was ruining the water, must be coming from a village of poisonous Grung upriver spawning in the waters
- For some reason they then threatened Yarr and gaslit him into believing they didn't find a mermaid
- On their way back through town they saw a crowd around [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Simon Sais\|Simon Sais]] and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Iwana Sais\|Iwana Sais]]'s house, upon further inspection they found [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reka Rearguard\|Reka Rearguard]] dead, clearly killed sometime in the middle of the night and found in the morning.  She had blunt trauma and a nasty bite taken out of her side, then she likely bled out.  She had a shovel with her.  
- Feannag interviewed Simon, he said he heard the banging on his door again and a scream around 3am.  Investigation cut short when town guards arrived and took over.  
- Trekked into [[Places/The High Forest\|The High Forest]] along the [[Places/Dessarin River\|Dessarin River]] for about 2 hours, found some Grung in the shallows of the river guarding a spawning pool full of tadpoles.  The Grung tried to chase them away, fired a warning shot and the party attacked and killed all but one who fled and went for backup.  
- While the air filled with the sounds of Grung in the trees the party considered whether or not to destroy the spawning pool and the ~300 tadpoles in it.  Nira blasted the pool with Sacred Flame before they fled
- Aired took a sample of Orange Grung Poison
### Session 2
*Greenwake 41*
- Aired tried out his new brewer's kit but the bottle exploded
- Feannag and Nira discussed how to keep the sheep safe in the future
- A town meeting was called, led by [[People/Other Adventurers/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]] and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reeve Fona Goldcrest\|Reeve Fona Goldcrest]], announcing that there was likely a shapeshifter in their midst.  The shapeshifter is dangerous and can assume anyone's form, so villagers should travel in groups of three for safety.  An investigation was being conducted to track down the shapeshifter.  Tony's Pajamas were found behind [[Places/The Bursting Barrel\|The Bursting Barrel]], so he was likely the shapeshifter and has taken on a new form
- [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Simon Sais\|Simon Sais]] spoke up at the meeting, saying there was a banging and scratching at his door around 3am last night
- Wrenn spoke up, concerned they were the shapeshifter after their magical lightning outburst the night before
- Nira pulled [[People/Other Adventurers/Gabriella Starsyx\|Gabriella Starsyx]] aside for a quick discussion of her fledgling magical abilities, though somewhat rude Gabriella was able to give her some pointers, Rip also followed along and both gained a modicum of control over simple spells
- Wrenn met with their mentor [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Tam Thunderhand\|Tam Thunderhand]], who revealed that he was a forge cleric adventurer before he settled in [[Places/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]], they worked together to forge a +1 shield and they learned to control a small amount of divine magic over a few hours of training montage
- Feannag talked with [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Foke Barnswaggle\|Foke Barnswaggle]], who mentioned the well by his house seems poisoned and also heard tales of a mermaid in the lake from some local fishermen, Feannag blames the Reeve
- Took a sample of water from the suspicious well and Aired analyzed it with his brewer's kit, decided to bring it to the expert: [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/'Greasy' Greg Gremble\|'Greasy' Greg Gremble]]
- Greg was in the middle of trying to "milk" the fluids of a Shambling Mound, a powerful plant monster of the High Forest.  The party helped him collect 3/5 spiles of fluid and escape the mound, but not before Wrenn and Aired dropped to 0HP
### Session 1
*Greenwake 40*
- Aired, Rip, and Cock all tried to distract the thugs robbing the tavern but ended up getting [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Honey O'Dell\|Honey O'Dell]] shot when a fight broke out
- Cock and Rip dropped to 0HP
- Wrenn tried and failed to use two spell scrolls, triggering wild magic surges.  The first frightened them and the second shot out a lightning bolt that immediately incinerated three of the bandits, causing the fourth to flee
- Feannag saw two bandits escaping on a cart along with Nira's sheep, who were being controlled by an odd staff
- Feannag and Aired chased the bandits down [[Places/The Wanderer's Path\|The Wanderer's Path]], then took a shortcut and set up an ambush on the switchbacks
- Rest of the party caught up and Nira convinced Aired to rub sheep shit on the wagon for some reason, then he lit the wagon on fire causing chaos to break out
- Four Fingered Freddy and the rest of the Juice Crew showed up to give the bandits backup, they dropped Nira to 0HP and nearly killed the party despite Feannag stealing the Crook of Command and controlling the animals to help them fight
- As Nira's life was fading she saw a vision of a dragon who claimed to be her ancestor from 1000 years ago, and that she was the last living relative of a line of great lunar sorcerers, the last being Nira's great-great grandmother Midna.  The dragon invited Nira to explore her new powers and someday visit her on the moon
- A burst of necrotic energy erupted from Nira, killing the remaining bandits and restoring her health as her lunar powers awakened.  
- Meanwhile Aired chased after one fleeing bandit, Tony Pajamas, who managed to escape after taking a suspiciously high amount of damage
- A party of adventurers came down the wandering path, introduced themselves as [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike\|Orbital Strike]], including [[People/Other Adventurers/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]], [[People/Other Adventurers/Gabriella Starsyx\|Gabriella Starsyx]], [[People/Other Adventurers/Void\|Void]], and [[People/Other Adventurers/Hubert Mugwort\|Hubert Mugwort]].  Said they were chasing a fugitive shapeshifter who had infiltrated Candlekeep's vault and stolen a powerful artifact known as the Astral Orb.  
- The party was pointed towards the bandit's camp down the road and looted it to find adventuring gear, gold, and a cache of magical items
- Cock found a Cloak of Billowing and a strange weapon called Pi'za that seemed to speak through him when he picked it up, calling him "Puppet" and mentioning that it used to be bonded to him before Cock broke the bond, destroying his memory in the process
- Long Rest
- Level up! (0->1)
